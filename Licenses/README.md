# SlickLM License support

SlickLM puts licenses into 3 categories:

- [`Copyleft`](/Licenses/Copyleft/)
- [`Copyright`](/Licenses/Copyright/)
- [`Public Domain`](/Licenses/Public-Domain/)

This is done to sort them out, instead of having all of them in a single directory, which would be a problem, due to license proliferation.

The current supported licenses include:

- [x] GNU GPL V1
- [x] GNU GPL V2
- [x] GNU GPL V3
- [x] GNU GFDL V1.1
- [x] GNU GFDL V1.2
- [x] GNU GFDL V1.3
- [x] GNU AfferoPL V3
- [x] GNU LGPL V2.0
- [x] GNU LGPL V2.1 
- [x] GNU LGPL V3.0
- [x] Eclipse Public License V2
- [x] Mozilla Public License V2 
- [x] Vim
- [x] MIT
- [x] Apache 2.0
- [x] Academic Free License 3.0
- [x] WTFPL 1.0
- [x] WTFPL 2.0
- [x] Unlicense  

I am still working on trying to add BSD-style and Creative Commons licenses to the collection (as of 2022, Tuesday, April 26th) but it is a lot of work, too much for me at the moment.
